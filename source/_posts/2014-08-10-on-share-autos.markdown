To get to work every day I could take two buses or two share autos and a bus or four share autos. When I started my career I used to prefer taking the bus whenever possible because I would leave home early and I had the patience to wait at bus stand. But then nowadays I leave for work betwen 9:45 AM and 10:30 AM and having to wait for buses in the scorching sun and even if I get buses quickly they would be completely packed most of the time. Having to stand throughout the entire 40 - 45 minute journey is not something one would want to do during their transit to work. So I prefer share autos even if it means I need to take 4 to get to work. 

Cost wise taking share autos is really bad becase it costs nearly 90% more than what it costs to take two share autos and a bus. But then you get to travel in a relatively comfortable manner especially after the Tamil Nadu government passed a ruling that only 4 people should be seated in the back and 99% of the time you dont have to stand somewhere and wait for them. Well okay I must admit that these minor comforts are not worth the extra 50 rupees Im having to spend but I guess I am just too lazy to take the bus. But then I am trying to change my highly irregular sleep / wake up timings so that I can get up early take the bus to work. 

I've been taking share autos for several months now and I've had several experiences that I would like to share. There are many things that I would like to be improved and regulated. This post is a collection of such experiences, thoughts and rants!

I mentioned earlier in this post that there is little waiting time when it comes to travelling by share autos. But annoyingly that is not the case sometimes. This is true especially when you board share autos at the starting point of a particular route. These drivers are very stubborn about filling the auto before starting the ride. I've waited for nearly 30 minutes on few occassions. Even if there is only on spot left and that to near the driver's seat (which is illegal) they wont leave. The situation is worse during the night time. By the time I take my 3rd share auto it becomes almost 9 or 9:30 PM and at that time you dont find many people wanting to take the share auto because they charge you extra. So it takes a really long time for the auto-wala to get 6 or 7 people. I've waited for more than an hour on few occassions. During most of these occassions I would see nearly 3 to 4 completely empty buses pass by (the auto stand is little away from the bus stop) and every time that happens I give a sad look to driver and he says "5 nimisham wait pannunga na" (please wait for 5 more minutes). 

Drivers making people to wait so that they can more passengers is somewhat understandable I think. Because after the government passed that order about the passenger limit the drivers became really angry because they used to carry upto 10 passengers and now the maximum allowed number is 4 and even if these drivers take 2 people in the front seat the profit they make has taken a significant hit. This resulted in a small hike in fares and drivers stubborn about taking maximum passengers before starting. 

But what I find extremely annoying and unforgivable is drivers halting in the middle of the route. Sometimes there would be only one or two passengers left and these drivers would mercilessly make us wait in the middle of the route for nearly 30 minutes. Again you would see almost empty buses passing you by and that and the hot sun makes your temper soar. Then there are few drivers who stop all of a sudden to take phone calls or to buy food and sometimes liquor! There was this driver who stopped the auto by the road side and walked to a store, borrowed a phone and talked for nearly 15 minutes. That made me really angry and I got down and took another auto that was passing by. The driver did not even mind me not paying.
