Its my birthday and I'm turning 23 today. I've been meaning to start a new blog (old one [here](http://footyntech.wordpress.com)) for a while now and I've finally taken that step today. I love blogging and I encourage people around me to do it but then for several months, interestingly right after I feel in love with Ruby and Rails I've stopped writing completely. I do not know why that happened but it just happened. I wrote these *come back posts* whenever I felt inspired to write something and I promised I would resume blogging but I never did. And I really don't know if this new blog would be any different. But I hope it is.

Alright why am I starting a new blog? Well, I don't have a proper reason for that. Its like I just don't feel like writing anymore over there in my old blog. Whenever I go through the old stuff I wrote, for some reason, I feel it just does not reflect who I am now. Maybe it did when I wrote them but now I think I've changed a lot. So I want to start afresh with this new blog. 

I'm Steve Robinson and I work as a technical consultant at [Spritle Software](http://sprite.com). I write code for a living and I write code as a hobby. Apart from software I'm interested in football (not hand-egg), humanitarian causes, politics, aviation and computer science. I have a pet GSD and his name is [Jim](http://instagram.com/p/ifq033MjsP) and like most programmers I know, I absolutely love coffee! I'm a Protestant Christian and I live in a medium sized dusty town called Avadi near Chennai. This is my life :)
